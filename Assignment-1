## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans- Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems.and high-level means it's easy for humans to understand.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans- In python Type of Variable determined during runtime,that's why it is called dynamically typed language.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans- 
Pros:
   1) Easy to learn
   2) Cross Platform Compatibility
   3) Extensible,great library support
   4) Large Community
Cons: 
  1) It is a dynamically typed language
  2) Python is unsuitable for complicated designs.
  3) It is not as fast as other standard compiled languages.
  4) Fails to offer 100% security.
  5) Python suffers from high memory consumption.

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans-
Machine learning / Artificial intelligence
Desktop GUI
Data analytics and data visualization 
Web development
Game development
Mobile app developme

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans-Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves.
 Pyhton has no command for declaring variable,variable are created when we assign value to it.
 
Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
 Ans- In put we take intput from user using input().

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans - String

Q8. What is type casting?
Ans- Typecasting is a conversion of one datatype to anoyther datatype.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans - We can take more than input from user using split() with input()
x,y  = input.split(" ")


Q10. What are keywords?
Ans- Keywords are the predefined reserved words for specific purpose.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans- No we can't use keyword as variable, it will throw syntax error.because keywords are reserved for some specific purpose and they treated  in the same way.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans- Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.In python indentation is used for defining blocks.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans- Using print().


Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans- operators are used to perform some computation between operands.
in python there are seven different types of operators: arithmetic operators, assignment operators, comparison operators, logical operators, identity operators, membership operators, and bitwise operators.


Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans- // is used for Integer division,means we got result in int and in case / we got result in float.

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

Q18. What are boolean operator?

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 - 1

0 and 0 - 1

True and False and True - False

1 or 0 or 0 - 1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans- If we want to perform some task on the basis of some condition then we use control structures. if,elif,else are the part of control structure.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
Ans-
age  = input("enter age")
if age>=18:
  print("I can vote")
else:
  print("I can't vote")
  
Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans- 
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
sum  = 0
for n in numbers:
  if(n%2==0):
    sum +=n
print(sum)

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
Ans- 
x,y,z = input("Enter Three number").split()
max = x
if(y>x):
  max = y
if(z>max):
  max = z
print(max)

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

Ans-
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
for n in numbers:
  if (n%5==0  and n<=150):
    print(n)
  else n>500:
    break
    
```
