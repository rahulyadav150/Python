## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans- Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems.and high-level means it's easy for humans to understand.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans- In python Type of Variable determined during runtime,that's why it is called dynamically typed language.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans- 
Pros:
   1) Easy to learn

Desktop GUI
Data analytics and data visualization 
Web development
Game development
Mobile app developme

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans-Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves.
 Pyhton has no command for declaring variable,variable are created when we assign value to it.
 
Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
 Ans- In put we take intput from user using input().

Ans - We can take more than input from user using split() with input()
x,y  = input.split(" ")


Q10. What are keywords?
Ans- Keywords are the predefined reserved words for specific purpose.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans- No we can't use keyword as variable, it will throw syntax error.because keywords are reserved for some specific purpose and they treated  in the same way.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans- Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.In python indentation is used for defining blocks.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans- Using print().


Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans- operators are used to perform some computation between operands.
in python there are seven different types of operators: arithmetic operators, assignment operators, comparison operators, logical operators, identity operators, membership operators, and bitwise operators.


Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans- // is used for Integer division,means we got result in int and in case / we got result in float.

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
Ans- 
Conditional Statement in Python perform different computations or actions depending on whether a specific Boolean constraint evaluates to true or false. Conditional statements are handled by IF statements in Python.
Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans- If we want to perform some task on the basis of some condition then we use control structures. if,elif,else are the part of control structure.

  max = z
print(max)

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

Ans-
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

    print(n)
  else n>500:
    break
    
```
Q26. What is a string? How can we declare string in Python?
Ans - Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.
      s = "hello"
      However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.

Ans - string = "Big Data iNeuron"
      print(string[::-1])
      
Q31. How can you delete entire string at once?
Ans- del s;
Q32. What is escape sequence?
Ans-An escape sequence is a sequence of characters that,
   when used inside a character or string, does not represent itself but is
   converted into another character or series of characters. So escape sequences are formed using two things:
   the first is a backslash (\\), and the second is the set of one or more characters following that backslash (\\).
  
   for e.g. \’	Single quote
   \\’	Double quote
   \\	Backslash
Q33. How can you print the below string?
```
'iNeuron's Big Data Course'
```
Ans-print("'iNeuron\'s Big Data Course'")
